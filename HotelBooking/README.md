# Hotel Booking System

## Overview
This project is a simple hotel booking system written in Python. It allows users to enter their details, select a room category, and choose a food preference to generate a bill. The program also checks age constraints to ensure bookings are only made for users 18 years or older.

## Features
- User input for name and date of birth
- Room category selection (High, Medium, Low)
- Food selection (Veg, Non-Veg)
- Age verification (Only 18+ allowed)
- Automated bill calculation
- Console-based interface with structured output
